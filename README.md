## ‚ùî What is AEGIS?


AEGIS is a composition created to provide Game Masters of Arma 3's gamemode "**Zeus**", an all-in-one package of essential modules to assist in simplifying and automating mission creation. AEGIS is a fork or derivative built off of the "**[Enhanced Zeus Modules](https://github.com/expung3d/Enhanced-Zeus-Modules)**" (EZM) framework originally created by GamesByChris and M9-SD, which was later adapted into its current form as a composition by Expung3d.

AEGIS provides an array of over **60+ new modules** encompassing major sought-after features, so Game Masters can spend less time perusing the Steam Workshop and more time providing their player's with their next best-ever experience. These modules include key features such as populating areas on demand for any faction, providing over 30+ automatically generated tasks, player-driven base building, saving/loading bases built in Zeus and much more described below.

So whether you are an experienced veteran of Zeus or someone just learning the ropes, AEGIS serves to provide a well-maintained platform for quality-of-life improvements, user-requested features, and an arsenal of enhanced modules. If you are looking for assistance in automating mission creation and providing players with more outlets to express their creativity and directly impact the flow of the scenario, then *AEGIS is perfect for you*.
